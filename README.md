# Predictive-Volatility-Optimization-Enhancing-Options-Pricing

The project, titled "Enhancing Volatility Prediction for Optimal Pricing," responds to the urgent demand for precise volatility forecasts in financial markets, particularly for a global electronic market maker operating across diverse asset classes. Volatility is a key factor influencing the pricing of options, ETFs, cash equities, bonds, and foreign currencies, and the project aims to refine predictive models to achieve fairer and more accurate options prices, benefiting both Financial Institutes and end investors.

The literature review underscores the importance of implied volatility (IV) in risk management and derivatives pricing, noting its forward-looking nature as a crucial element in explaining future volatility. Various IV estimation methods, including backwardation, time-series volatility models like GARCH, and artificial neural network models, are explored. While GARCH models dominate time-series volatility modeling, there's a debate on the use of Black-Scholes implied volatility, adding complexity to the literature. The study proposes investigating the performance of the underexplored Artificial Bee Colony-Back Propagation (ABC-BP) neural network model in IV predictability and its application to diverse option trading strategies.

This research aims to bridge a literature gap by evaluating the ABC-BP model's effectiveness in IV predictability and its applicability to various option trading strategies. The comprehensive framework of the study encompasses a thorough literature review, methodology, results, and implications, contributing valuable insights to the evolving field of volatility prediction.
